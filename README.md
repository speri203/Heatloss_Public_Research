The collaboration between the University of North Dakota (UND) and SkySkopes Inc. through the support of the North Dakota Department of Commerce has produced 2 posters and 4 scientific journal papers (as attached in this repo) in the domains of image processing, machine learning, and software development as part of an ongoing effort to improve buildings' thermal efficiency through the use of  Infrared (IR) imagery and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
